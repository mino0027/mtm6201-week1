            <p>Hi, I am Chris. For this assignment in MTM6201; the following is a brief bio. I am a former personal trainer/ coach in which I have some experience managing my own business. I love nature and often camp, fish, kayak and explore the world as much as I can. 
                
            I desire to see the world and create new experiences. I have visited a few countries so far hoping to grow the number again since COVID had us locked up for two years. I have been to the US, Italy and after saving up with my girlfriend; backpacking in Ireland/ Croatia has had me itching since restrictions have been lifted to get back out there after saving up again. If I'm not working I'm often out with friends, on the water, or in the woods. </p>
